## Introduction
Machine translation is the process of using artificial intelligence to automatically translate text from one language to another. This contains the model of machine translation for english to indonesian.

## Features
- Implementation of various machine translation models
- Tools for data preprocessing and tokenization
- Evaluation metrics for translation quality
- Sample scripts for training and inference
All of included in the jupyter notebook file

## Installation
To get started, you can run it on the Google Colab platform 

## Datasets
